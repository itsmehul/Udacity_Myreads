# MyReads Project

This is the first assignment of the udacity course due for submission. The application allows users to search for books available on google books and categorize them by 'currently reading', 'want to read', and 'read'

## TL;DR

To use the application on your local machine:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
